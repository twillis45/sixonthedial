/**
 * Does reduced motion still say anything?
 *
 * `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` used to collapse every animation on the
 * page to 0.01ms. That is the standard blanket rule and it is the right
 * floor, but several animations here are not decoration — they are the only
 * channel a piece of feedback has, and killing them removes information
 * rather than movement.
 *
 * The sharp case is the invalid word. The board rejects it in exactly two
 * ways: a haptic tap, which a desktop does not have, and the shake. With the
 * shake gone, a reduced-motion player on a laptop submits a wrong word and
 * gets nothing back — no way to tell "rejected" from "the key didn't
 * register". This script exists so that cannot silently return.
 *
 * What it asserts, in both media states:
 *
 *   reduce ON  — the signals that carry meaning still animate (non-trivial
 *                duration), and none of them animates by MOVING: no transform
 *                in the substituted keyframes, because translation and scale
 *                are the vestibular triggers the setting is actually about.
 *   reduce OFF — the real animations are intact, so a mistake in the reduced
 *                block cannot quietly become everyone's experience.

 * It deliberately does not play a board — which word is solvable depends on
