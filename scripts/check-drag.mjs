/*
 * Dragging across the dial must spell what your finger actually crossed —
 * including after the dial has turned.
 *
 * THE DIAL ROTATES. It advances 60° per solved row, by CSS transform, so where
 * a tile IS on screen stops matching where the geometry THINKS it is. The
 * component reconciles that with `toRing`/`toWorld`: a pointer is converted
 * into ring space once, and every consumer — hit test, pull, parallax —
 * compares against ring-space positions. A regression there does not crash. It
 * spells a different word than the one you traced, which reads as the game
 * being broken rather than the input being wrong.
 *
 * WHY THIS GUARD IS WRITTEN THE WAY IT IS. Four earlier attempts to verify
 * this proved nothing, each differently, and every one of them looked like a
 * passing check at the time:
 *
 *   - one dragged all six tiles, so any permutation matched and it could not
 *     fail;
 *   - one queried the wrong element and measured something that was not the
 *     dial;
 *   - one sorted the result, destroying the ordering it existed to test;
 *   - and two runs today typed a six-letter word on a board whose grid was
 *     never checked, so no row completed, the dial never turned, and the whole
 *     exercise tested the one condition where the bug cannot occur.
 *
 * So this asserts the ROTATION ACTUALLY HAPPENED before it trusts a single
 * drag, drags a SHORT ordered subset rather than everything, and compares the
 * exact sequence rather than a set.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT, because it matters for what a green run means: these are
 * synthetic mouse events. A real finger produces coalesced moves, variable
 * pressure and touch rather than mouse. A pass here does not clear the touch
 * path; it clears the geometry.

 * THE BOARD IS READ, NOT NAMED.
 *
 * This block used to hardcode board 113 — `crafty / cart / tray / cry / fat /
 * fry` — with a comment explaining that naming it was the fix, because an
 * assumed board had already made two runs prove nothing. The comment was right
 * about the failure and wrong about the remedy: bae5523 CHOSE a different
 * first board, and from that commit every tile this check reached for was
 * missing. It reported "the dial spells the wrong word after it turns" on
 * every run, which is a frightening sentence about a core interaction, and it
 * was never true.
 *
 * A six-letter word that is not a ROW banks as bonus and turns nothing, so the
 * words still have to be real rows of the real board — that part stands. They
 * just have to be derived from the shipped ladder rather than typed in here.
 *
 * The wheel escalates: active letters are `unlockOrder.slice(0, startActive +
 * rowsDone)`, so the plan has to be simulated forward rather than picked. The
 * two "after 1" drags are rows themselves and bank as they are dragged, which
 * is what carries the dial from 60° to 180° — so the plan needs five of the
 * six rows, in an order where each is spellable when it is reached.
