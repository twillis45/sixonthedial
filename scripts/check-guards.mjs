/**
 * Who guards the guards.
 *
 * Every check script in this repo exists because something broke silently.
 * That gives them a shared weakness worth testing directly: a guard written
 * to catch the bug that just happened tends to assert THAT BUG rather than
 * the invariant behind it, and then passes the next time the same property
 * fails a slightly different way. This is not hypothetical. On 2026-08-21,
 * in one session:
 *
 *   check-rail passed while the Streak card was permanently half-erased by a
 *   gradient — it asserted the card was not CUT, and a card ending flush with
 *   the edge is not cut.
 *
 *   check-rail passed again while a NEW card above Streak was clipped —
 *   it only ever looks at Streak.
 *
 *   check-tiles passed while every filled row rendered its letters clipped —
 *   the tile was the right size and the font was the right size and nothing
 *   compared the line box to the box it had to fit in.
 *
 * So: deliberately break something, rebuild, and assert the guard NOTICES.
 * A guard that cannot fail is decoration, and this script is the only thing
 * in the repo that can tell the difference.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-guards.mjs
 *
 * Slow by nature — one production build per mutation. It is not part of the
 * fast loop; it is what you run when you have added a guard, or when a guard
 * has just failed to catch something.

 * SAFETY, and it is not theoretical — this script corrupted the working tree
 * the first time it ran.
 *
 * The first run was killed by a two-minute timeout WHILE a mutation was
 * applied, leaving the break on disk. The next run then read that broken file
 * as its "original", found its anchor missing, reported a skip, and faithfully
 * restored the damage. A harness that deliberately writes bugs into source has
 * to assume it will be interrupted, because it will be.
 *
 * Three guarantees, in order of how much they are worth:
 *
 *   1. Refuse to start on a dirty tree. If the files this touches already have
 *      uncommitted changes there is no safe "original" to restore, and a
 *      restore would silently destroy real work.
 *   2. Restore from GIT, not from a string held in memory. Git's copy survives
 *      this process dying; a variable does not.
 *   3. Restore on the way out — best effort only, and worth being honest
 *      about: `execSync` blocks the event loop, so a signal arriving while a
 *      build is running cannot run a JS handler at all. Verified by killing a
 *      run mid-build: the tree was left mutated and the handler never fired.
 *      So (3) catches the tidy exits and (1) is what actually prevents damage
 *      — the next run refuses to start rather than baking the break in as a
 *      new "original", which is precisely the failure this script caused the
 *      first time it ran.
