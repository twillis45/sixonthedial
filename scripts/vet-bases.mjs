/**
 * Base vetting — run this BEFORE authoring clues, not after.
 *
 * Authoring a themed pack means picking a 6-letter base and writing six clues
 * for it. The expensive failure mode is discovering at build time that the base
 * was never viable: the first two packs came back with seven rejects, and every
 * one of them cost a full re-author of six clues. The build's rules are knowable
 * up front, so there is no reason to learn them at the end.
 *
 * A base is viable when ALL of these hold — the same checks build-puzzles.mjs
 * applies, in the same order:
 *
 *   • six letters, all distinct, in ENABLE1, not on the blocklist
 *   • in common use (popular.txt), or the build drops it outright
 *   • its answer set is 24-110 words, the band claimed puzzles are held to
 *   • at least five of its rows can be common words, since a featured board
 *     needs 5/6 common rows and the base is only one of them
 *   • not already claimed by an existing puzzle
 *
 * Output is a JSON pool: every viable base with its answer count and its
 * COMMON rows, longest first. An author picks five rows from that list and
 * writes to them. Nothing they hand back can be rejected for structure.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/vet-bases.mjs                 # write data/base-pool.json
 *   node scripts/vet-bases.mjs cash fry oil    # only bases whose rows match
