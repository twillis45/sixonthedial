/*
 * A MULTISET, for the same reason `canSpell` in the build is one.
 *
 * This gate carried three rules that the build and vet-bases had already left
 * behind, and all three rejected content that ships legally today:
 *
 *   • the base had to be six DISTINCT letters. vet-bases allows one doubled
 *     letter — six distinct or five-plus-a-pair — because six-distinct threw
 *     away 103 of 215 six-letter theme words. WOBBLE, SPIRIT, CAMERA and
 *     ATTEND are all shipping and all would have been refused here.
 *   • a ROW had to be six distinct letters too, which is wrong for the same
 *     reason one step down: ATTEND carries two Ts, so TENT is legal and this
 *     called it a repeat.
 *   • spellability was checked with a Set, so a base's second copy of a letter
 *     was invisible. That is the identical bug build-puzzles fixed at its
 *     unlock ladder, where it shipped five broken boards before anyone saw it.
 *
 * A gate that refuses valid work is not a safe failure. It teaches whoever
 * hits it that the gate is wrong and can be skipped, which is how the merge
 * step became advisory the first time.

   * Measured across the Nineties: DEARLY and NICKED are the only two boards at
