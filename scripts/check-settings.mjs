/*
 * A setting that does not take is worse than a setting that is missing.
 *
 * Two accents were added and neither applied: `applyAccent` still read
 * `next === 'matte'` and DELETED the attribute for anything else, so choosing
 * Tide set the label to "Tide" and left the page green. The pre-paint script
 * had the same two-value assumption and would have painted any stored accent
 * orange on the first frame — two bugs cancelling into one wrong colour, which
 * is precisely why nothing looked broken enough to notice.
 *
 * No test caught it. The unit tests checked that the COLOURS were readable and
 * the labels existed; nothing drove the control and asked whether the page
 * changed. That gap is what this file is.
 *
 * THE EXPECTATIONS ARE DERIVED FROM SOURCE, not restated here. The accent
 * order comes from accent.ts and the colours from globals.css, so a fifth
 * accent is covered the day it is added rather than the day somebody
 * remembers this file. A guard that has to be updated by hand to keep working
 * is the kind that quietly stops.
