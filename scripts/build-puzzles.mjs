   *
   * The first version of this fix checked that cumulative distinct letters
   * grew by at most one per word. That is necessary and NOT sufficient, and
   * the gap is repeated letters: on `poison` (i n o o p s) the second `o`
   * satisfied "grew by one" while opening no word at all, so the board still
   * stalled. Five boards survived the first fix that way — poison, demure,
   * raging, beater, suntan, every one of them a base with a doubled letter.
   *
   * So the plan simulates what actually happens: you hold a multiset, solving
   * a row grants exactly one more letter, and the next word must be spellable
   * from what you then hold. A word needing two letters you do not have can
   * never be next, however the arithmetic looks.

 * came straight from church and has not sat down" — and every clue lands for
 * anybody who has cooked a big meal. Culturally specific and legible are not
 * opposites; CRAFTY was simply both hard and specific, which conflated them.

 * on board two.
