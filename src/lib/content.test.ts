   * three of six rows, against a catalogue where 113 of 131 boards have none.
   *

   * assuming a burn barrel feeds a pit, and carries no recall marker at all.
   * Domain-gating is the other locked door and only a human reader sees it.
   * This catches the half that is machine-visible, and claims only that half.
