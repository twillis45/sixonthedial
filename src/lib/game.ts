 * more than a day old until there has been a second day. The moment meant to
 * land as an achievement spent two thirds of its space naming things the
 * player did not have yet.
 *
 * So a stat appears only once it can mean something:
 *
 * - Score always. Clearing a board takes six words, so it is never zero.
 * - Bonus once there is one. Zero bonus words is not a result, it is the
 *   default.
 * - Streak once it is longer than a day. `1` is not a streak, it is today —
 *   the rail already draws this exact line for the same reason ("Play
 *   tomorrow to start a streak").
 *
 * Warm-up progress fills the gap when there is one, because it is the thing
 * that IS true on a first clear: you have finished one of two. It is added
 * last and only if a slot is free, so it never pushes out a real result.
