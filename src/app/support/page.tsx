        <strong>A real word wasn&rsquo;t accepted.</strong> Each puzzle carries a
        fixed answer list built from a standard word list. Some genuine words
        are missing from it. Tell us and we will look.

        <strong>Some letters are dim.</strong> They unlock as you fill rows. You
        can turn that off under the <em>?</em> button.
