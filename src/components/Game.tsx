   * of ~300 and overflowed the rail by 112px while `data-text` read
   * "default" and every guard I ran at Chrome's stock 16px came back clean.

   * were not running the same browser settings.

   * One number covers both axes. Our own scales multiply the browser's value
   * — large is 115% of whatever it already was — so the computed root px is

        The first run used to be a MODAL, and the player board changed it.

        Their reasoning, in the order it convinced: a dismiss-on-tap-anywhere
        dialog in front of a screen-reader player is a focus trap with no
        labelled close — that was the strongest argument on the table, ahead of
        any comparison to Wordle. Then, of its four sentences, exactly ONE was
        load-bearing: the count and where the letters come from, which is the
        only claim the board cannot make on its own. Row chips already carry
        their length, the chips already say "tap for the next clue", and the
        rank chip already says "fill the six rows".

        The hint rule was cut deliberately, not lost: nobody plans around a
        three-word faucet before they have found three words, and a token
        arriving unannounced reads as a gift rather than a rule.

        So it is one line, it does not block, and it dismisses itself by being
        obeyed rather than acknowledged. Grandmother's standing BLOCK on "no
        paid tier before an in-app first-run teach" is satisfied by a
        persistent strip; a cold board with no goal statement would trip it.

        adding two more settings rows the same day. A player who wants the

        play" — and a screen-reader user navigating by dialog name has no
        reason to ever open it.
          
        Renaming is the honest half of the fix. The larger half — a separate
        entry point in the header — is a real change to a header that already
        carries four controls, and it should be its own decision rather than
        something smuggled in beside a rename.

              four of 108 viewport/text combinations overflowed, because the

              0 — while a reminder link renders always, so it added a row where
              the rail had none. 1600x1130 failed by a single pixel, which is
              how much slack that surface actually has.
              
              A reminder is a preference, not status: set once, never looked at
              again. This sheet is where the other set-once decisions live, and
